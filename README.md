# Dev GenAI Text to Text Blueprint

## Overview

This repository contains resources and examples for integrating Dev GenAI's powerful AI models into your projects. Our goal is to provide a straightforward guide for leveraging OpenAI's capabilities in a way that aligns with our organization's standards and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have provisioned Dev GenAI Text to Text service and downloaded the API-KEY. This is a mandatory step to use this blueprint.

## Getting Started

In this repository, you'll find Python examples and detailed documentation to help you get started with Dev GenAI's API. We focus on showing how to interact with different Dev GenAI models, including the popular mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01, llamaguard-7b, phi-3-mini-128k-instruct, llama-3-8b-instruct and mistral-7b-instruct-v03.

For detailed documentation, you can go through [Dev GenAI](https://confluence.dell.com/display/DSX/Request+GenAI+Model+Access) Confluence Page.
