ðŸ“¦ Input Fields per Order:
1. Client Sessions â†’ Client-Sessions: A list of user interactions with page titles, durations, and event counts.
2. Server Sessions â†’ Server-Sessions: A list of server-side errors with time, URL, HTTP status, and total time.
3. Carepulse API Data â†’ Order Details:
â€¢ IssueType (e.g., Shipping Delay, Delivery Delay, Missing Carrier Link, Waybill Email Failure, Payment Issue, Technical Error)
â€¢ OrderStatus (e.g., InProduction, Shipped, Delivered)
â€¢ OrderType (e.g., MX Order, B2B)
â€¢ OrderSource (e.g., OMAR, Web)
4. Customer Comment â†’ Improve Text: A free-text comment from the user.
5. GIA Insights â†’ GIA Insights: AI-generated behavioral insights and session summaries that highlight user struggles (e.g., reloads, navigation loops, failed interactions, confusion).


ðŸ§¾ Output Format:
Return a concise 2-line summary for each order in the following format:
Reason: <client-side, server-side, shipping delay, delivery delay, missing carrier link, waybill email failure, other>
Details: <brief explanation of the issue based on the data, ideally matching the user's comment>

âœ… Instructions for Analysis:
1. GIA Insights:
â€¢ Prioritize any behavioral struggles (e.g., reloads, loops, failed interactions).
â€¢ Use these to detect client-side issues even if not visible in raw session data.
2. Client Sessions:
â€¢ Look for signs of confusion: repeated navigation, long durations, high event counts.
â€¢ Cross-reference with GIA Insights for confirmation.
3. Server Sessions:
â€¢ Identify HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500) and broken URLs.
â€¢ If present, include server-side in the reason.
4. Carepulse API:
â€¢ Use the categorization logic to map IssueType to a known category.
â€¢ If a known issue is present, use that as the primary reason.
5. Customer Comment:
â€¢ analyze the sentiment of the customer comment and check if it matches any of the above issues.
â€¢ If the comment clearly matches a known issue, use that as the sole reason.
â€¢ If not, infer the most likely cause using all available data.
6. Accuracy Priority:
â€¢ Do not omit server-side errors if present.
â€¢ Do not ignore GIA insights if they indicate a struggle.
â€¢ If multiple causes are valid, list them (e.g., client-side, server-side).
